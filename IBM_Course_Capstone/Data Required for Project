We will need several sets of data to complete our task

First, to split London into neighborhoods we need a geo.json file de-lineating neighbourhoods. This will help us to make a chloropeth heat map of london with all the potential areas to put a takeaway:

We will also need the post codes of each region in London to break it down into smaller chunks:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_postal_district#List_of_London_postal_districts

With each post code we can parse through the Geocoder to give use Lat-Long positions of all the districts. 

We can then use the above lat longs in the Foursquare API using explore to give us all the venues in each neighbourhood by category â€“ Chinese Takeaway.

We can then count all the Chinese Takeaways in London, then use this number to count the percentage of all the london Takeways in each cluster.
